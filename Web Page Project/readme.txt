Jimmy Tran here.

I'm actually quite proud of my web site despite how lackluster it looks. I coded all of it using my own ideas and just basic Notepad.
I did originally try to use your website to create my logo bar but it ended up being messy and really bad in general.
So I just did everything myself using W3Schools as a reference.

For the most part, it was fun despite all the work needed to code it piece by piece. The only trouble I had was with the APIs.
I couldn't get the Facebook like button or the google+ follow button to work despite whatever I tried.
Oddly, it did work on the W3Schools html editor so I guess I'm just missing something important in my coding.

I had fun though, and I definitely improved compared to when I had to learn html from scratch for a CSC 2310 homework assignment.
I've attached that too so you can see how well I can do now. Don't think it's part of my project web site by mistake! I don't want to lose points!
Looking back though, my coding was really horrible and ugly compared to now.
So thank you for teaching the course Professor Han. I really appreciate it.
